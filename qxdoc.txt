This text file is for documenting the the QX language.
Variables:
    There are three supported variable types:
    int - Integers, like 1 or -7
    str - Strings, like "Hello"
    bool - Boolean, i.e. TRUE or FALSE

    Variables are defined like this:
        [varType] [varName] = [value];
    Examples:
        int num = 1;
        str msg = "Monosodium Glutamate.";
        bool amICool = FALSE;

Functions:
    ARM:
        Does basic arithmetic on SrcA and SrcB and stores the result into Dest.
        Usage: 
            ARM([Operation], [Dest], [SrcA], [SrcB]);
            [Operation] The arithmetic operation to perform. 
            Supported operations include:
                ADD: Addition
                SUB: Substraction
                MUL: Multiplication
                DIV: Integer Division
            [Dest] The variable that will be store the result. If the variable has not been previously defined, 
            then behavior is undefined. 
            [SrcA] The first operand.
            [SrcB] The second operand.
        Alternate Usage:
            In addtion to the traditional syntax, the ARM function can be called
            like this:
            [Dest] = [SrcA] [Operation] [SrcB];
            Note that [Operation] uses the traditional symbols (i.e, +, -, *) 
            instead of the string constants like with standard usage.
        Example:
            ARM(ADD, $var, 2, 2); OR $var = 2 + 2;
            Will store the result of 2 + 2 in var. 
        

    JUMP:
        Jumps to the given label.
        Usage:
        JUMP([Label]);
        Label - The name of the given label. 
    JUMPIF:

    END:
